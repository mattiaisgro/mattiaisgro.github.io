_Abstract:_ In this article I will introduce the quantum time evolution operator drawing parallels with classical mechanics and continuous transformations.

Classical mechanics and time evolution
------

In the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, we can consider groups of continuous transformations operating on a given system, starting from infinitesimal canonical transformations (canonical transformations which differ _slightly_ from identity), in the general form:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial p_i} + o(\epsilon) \ \ \ , \ \ \ P_i = p_i - \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial q_i} + o(\epsilon) $$

Generated by the functions:
$$ F = q_i p_i + \epsilon G, \ \ \ G = G(q_i, p_i) $$

(where we can exchange $p_i$ and $P_i$ by working at first order) {: .notice}

If we now consider common preserved quantities, like angular momentum and energy, it can be demonstrated that these functions over phase space generate infinitesimal continuous transformations. For instance, angular momentum generates a continuous rotation. Meanwhile, the Hamiltonian function $H(q_i, p_i)$ generates a particular transformation:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} + o(\epsilon) = q_i + \epsilon \dot{q_i} + o(\epsilon) \n $$
$$ P_i = p_i - \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} + o(\epsilon) = p_i + \epsilon \dot{p_i} + o(\epsilon) $$

This is the time evolution of trajectories over phase space at first order!
