Classical mechanics and time evolution
------

In the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, we can consider groups of continuous transformations operating on a given system, starting from canonical infinitesimal transformations (canonical transformations which differ _slightly_ from identity), in the general form:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial p_i} \ , \ \ \ P_i = p_i - \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial q_i} $$


Generated by the functions:
$$ F = q_i p_i + \epsilon G, \ \ \ G = G(q_i, p_i) $$

(where we can exchange $p_i$ and $P_i$ by working at first order) {: .notice}
