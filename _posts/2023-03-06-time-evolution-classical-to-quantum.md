_Abstract:_ In this article I will introduce the quantum time evolution operator drawing parallels with classical mechanics and continuous transformations.

_Prerequisites:_ Hamiltonian mechanics, Quantum mechanics (at an introductory level)

Classical mechanics and time evolution
------

In the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, we can consider groups of continuous transformations operating on a given system, starting from infinitesimal canonical transformations (canonical transformations which differ _slightly_ from identity), in the general form:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial p_i} + o(\epsilon)$$

$$P_i = p_i - \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial q_i} + o(\epsilon) $$

Generated by the functions:
$$ F(q_i, p_i) = q_i p_i + \epsilon G(q_i, p_i), \ \ \ G = G(q_i, p_i) $$

We can exchange $p_i$ and $P_i$ where the substitution is second order by working at first order in $\epsilon$
{: .notice}

If we now consider common preserved quantities, like angular momentum and energy, it can be demonstrated that these functions over phase space generate infinitesimal continuous transformations. For instance, angular momentum generates a continuous rotation. Meanwhile, the Hamiltonian function $H(q_i, p_i)$ generates a particular transformation:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} + o(\epsilon)$$

$$ P_i = p_i - \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} + o(\epsilon)$$

And substituting with Hamilton's equations gives:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \dot{q_i} + o(\epsilon) $$

$$ P_i = p_i + \epsilon \dot{p_i} + o(\epsilon) $$

This is the time evolution of trajectories over phase space at first order!
