_Abstract:_ In this article I will introduce the quantum time evolution operator drawing parallels with classical mechanics and continuous transformations.

_Prerequisites:_ Hamiltonian mechanics, Quantum mechanics (at an introductory level)

Classical mechanics and time evolution
------

In the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics, we can consider groups of continuous transformations operating on a given system, starting from infinitesimal canonical transformations (canonical transformations which differ _slightly_ from identity), in the general form:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial p_i} + o(\epsilon)$$

$$P_i = p_i - \epsilon \frac{\partial G}{\partial q_i} + o(\epsilon) $$

Generated by the functions:
$$ F(q_i, p_i) = q_i p_i + \epsilon G(q_i, p_i), \ \ \ G = G(q_i, p_i) $$

We can exchange $p_i$ and $P_i$ where the substitution is second order by working at first order in $\epsilon$

If we now consider common preserved quantities, like angular momentum and energy, it can be demonstrated that these functions over phase space generate infinitesimal continuous transformations. For instance, angular momentum generates a continuous rotation. Meanwhile, the Hamiltonian function $H(q_i, p_i)$ generates a particular transformation:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} + o(\epsilon)$$

$$ P_i = p_i - \epsilon \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i} + o(\epsilon)$$

And substituting with Hamilton's equations gives:

$$ Q_i = q_i + \epsilon \dot{q_i} + o(\epsilon) $$

$$ P_i = p_i + \epsilon \dot{p_i} + o(\epsilon) $$

This is the time evolution of trajectories over phase space at first order!
The Hamiltonian is then a function generating an ICT which maps points over phase space to the points of the same phase space after an "infinitesimal" time $\epsilon$ has passed, over the trajectories of motion:
$$ q_i (t + \epsilon) = q_i(t) + \epsilon \dot{q_i}(t) + o(\epsilon) $$
$$ p_i (t + \epsilon) = p_i(t) + \epsilon \dot{p_i}(t) + o(\epsilon) $$

Classical time evolution operator
------
We can go even a step further and define an operator $ \hat{H} = [\ \cdot \ , \ H \ ] $ which gives the time derivative of a function over phase space by the identity $ \dot f = [\ f \ , \ H \ ] $. If we exponentiate this operator, we obtain a new operator which acts upon a function like this:

$$
e^{t \hat H}f = (\ \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{t^n}{n!} \hat{H}^n \ ) \ f
= 1 + t \ [\ f \ , \ H \ ] + \frac{1}{2} t^2 \ [ \ [\ f \ , \ H \ ], \ H \ ]
= 1 + \dot{f}t + \frac{1}{2}t^2 \ddot{f} + \ ...
$$

In this power series, the derivates should be evaluated at $t = 0$.

This new operator evolves our system in time, given the initial conditions.

A similar idea is used to construct _symplectic integrators_ in numerical methods.

Applied to $q_i, p_i$, it gives back the previous result for small $t$ (the $\epsilon$ parameter is then time itself):

$$ q_i(t) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{t^n}{n!} (\frac{d^n}{dt^n} q_i)\,_{\rvert t = 0} = q_i(0) + t \ \dot{q_i}(0) + o(t) $$

$$ p_i(t) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{t^n}{n!} (\frac{d^n}{dt^n} p_i)\,_{\rvert t = 0} = p_i(0) + t \ \dot{p_i}(0) + o(t) $$
